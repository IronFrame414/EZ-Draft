Ticket EZD-000b, 2026-10-19
Mistake: two repo-script tests went red in later runs: one hard-coded the next Q-IDs from a copy of the live ledger, one built hook inputs under the real repo root, which inside a ticket worktree changed the hook's answer.
Cause: the tests depended on live repo state (ledger size, checkout location) instead of fixed inputs.
Rule: a repo-script test derives expected values from its own fixture or copy (e.g. next ID = highest in the copy + 1) and feeds path-sensitive tools a fixed fake root, never the checkout it runs in.
Check: the test passes both in the main checkout and in a `.claude/worktrees/EZD-000b` worktree, and after one row is added to the copied ledger (Q-0136).
